        “Male fantasies, male fantasies, is everything run by male fantasies? <br> 
        Up on a pedestal or down on your knees, it's all a male fantasy: that you're strong enough to take what they dish out, or else too weak to do anything about it. <br>
        Even pretending you aren't catering to male fantasies is a male fantasy: pretending you're unseen, pretending you have a life of your own, that you can wash your feet and comb your hair unconscious of the ever-present watcher peering through the keyhole, peering through the keyhole in your own head, if nowhere else.
        <br> You are a woman with a man inside watching a woman. You are your own voyeur.” 
        <br> - Margaret Atwood
